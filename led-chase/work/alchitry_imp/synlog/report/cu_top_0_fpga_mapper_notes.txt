@N: MF666 |Clock conversion enabled. (Command "set_option -fix_gated_and_generated_clocks 1" in the project file.)
@N: MT204 |Auto Constrain mode is disabled because clocks are defined in the SDC file

@N: MT615 |Found clock clk_0 with period 10.00ns 
@N: MT320 |This timing report is an estimate of place and route data. For final timing results, use the FPGA vendor place and route report.
@N: MT322 |Clock constraints include only register-to-register paths associated with each individual clock.
