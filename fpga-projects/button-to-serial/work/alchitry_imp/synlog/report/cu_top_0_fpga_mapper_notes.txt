@N: MF666 |Clock conversion enabled. (Command "set_option -fix_gated_and_generated_clocks 1" in the project file.)
@N: MT204 |Auto Constrain mode is disabled because clocks are defined in the SDC file

@N: FX1016 :"/home/tumo/fpga-workspace/button-to-serial/work/verilog/cu_top_0.v":8:10:8:12|SB_GB_IO inserted on the port clk.
@N: FX1017 :|SB_GB inserted on the net btn_cond.M_sync_out_i[0].
@N: BW103 |The default time unit for the Synopsys Constraint File (SDC or FDC) is 1ns.

@N: MT615 |Found clock clk_0 with period 10.00ns 
@N: MT320 |This timing report is an estimate of place and route data. For final timing results, use the FPGA vendor place and route report.
@N: MT322 |Clock constraints include only register-to-register paths associated with each individual clock.
